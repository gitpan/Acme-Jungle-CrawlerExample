This is an example of how to use Jungle web spider.
see ./lib/Acme/Jungle/CrawlerExample.pm 
and ./lib/NewsSpider/Terra.pm            #this is our spider
and ./lib/Data/News.pm                   #this is our data handler, will handle extraced data 
and see the test t/001_load.t            #shows how to start the spidering
